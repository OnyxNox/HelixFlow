# HelixFlow

**HelixFlow** is a microservice-based ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) engine built as a platform for hands-on exploration of emerging technologies outside my current toolkit. While grounded in distributed systems principles, the project's primary focus is deepening my experience with newer tools through practical application.

## Startup

1. Run docker compose detached from the repository's root directory, starting all of HelixFlow's services.
    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Shutdown

1. Run docker compose container shutdown from the repository's root directory.
    ```shell
    docker compose down
    ```
